## Technologies Used
### Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python.

### Database Storage
Mongo is the database we intend to use, and we will integrate Flask to display the data.

### Machine Learning
Scikit-Learn is the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier. We will be using an unsupervised ML model. 

### Dashboard
In addition to using a Flask template, we will also integrate D3.js for a fully functioning and interactive dashboard. The dashboard will be hosted on Tableau.
