## Communication Protocols

### General
If assistance from another team member is needed, it is best to email them. Emails for all team members are listed in the Slack group chat. Speaking of Slack, given that most of the members respond best to email, it is best to mostly use Slack to communicate and relay information during class breakout sessions. In situations where written communication is not sufficient to tackle a problem, a group member can set up a Zoom conference and invite required members. 

### Emergency
In case of emergency, it is best to use email to communicate, since group members seem to check email more often than Slack. 


## Technologies Used
### Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python.

### Database Storage
Mongo is the database we intend to use, and we will integrate Flask to display the data.

### Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier. 

### Dashboard
In addition to using a Flask template, we will also integrate D3.js for a fully functioning and interactive dashboard. It will be hosted on Tableu.
